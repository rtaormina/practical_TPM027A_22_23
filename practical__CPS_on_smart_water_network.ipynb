    "C-Town Public Utility (CPU) is the water distribution system operator of C-Town (see Figure 1). The network consists of 429 pipes, 388 junctions, 7 storage tanks, 11 pumps (distributed across 5 pumping stations), 1 actionable valve (V1), and a single reservoir (e.g., drinking water source). Water consumption is fairly regular throughout the year. \n",

    "C-Town is a Smart Water Network, where the physical assets are supervised by of 9 PLCs, which are located in proximity to pumps, storage tanks, and valves. Actuators are controlled based on high-low water levels in the respective controlling tank. Most of the PLCs controlling the pumps receive the information needed by the control logic from other PLCsâ€”for instance, PLC1 controls Pumps PU1 and PU2 on the basis of Tank T1 water level, which is monitored by PLC2 (Table 1). \n",

This causes an overflow in Tank T1 (thick darkly shaded line). To conceal the action, the attacker alters the signal sent by PLC2 to the SCADA system (dashed line) by adding a time-varying offset (thin shaded line).

Does this comparison with expected normal operation conditions help the detection of the attacks?\n",

Of course, you can work in teams!\n",
